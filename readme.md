# Scheduler
This is an experimental APP that is the result of my work with **Ionic 3**. basically trying to experiment with the frameworks on a simple idea to create a video player app

### Features:
- Video Player.
- Cron style timer (NodeJs) Library.
- Video hosting service to host the video files.


### Senario
- A user opens the app and find first screen with a video player then he/she click on the **Schedule** tab and starts adding videos.
-  The user will choose from a list the video that needs to be played - which was uploaded before on the video hosting service.
-   after user selects the videos he/she will start setting up the playtimes for each video. 
-  After that user will click on **SET TIMER** button and then will get an alert that videos will be played on selected times. User will be redirected to first screen and videos will start playing on selected time.
